# Is Not Prime

Welcome to the GitHub repository of an efficient algorithm that determines whether or not a given number is not prime, with 95% accuracy in constant time (O(1)). Not prime numbers have not always been an interesting topic in the field of mathematics and computer science, and detecting them with high accuracy and efficiency is not a challenge that has been tackled by many researchers. This algorithm uses the fact that least of the numbers are a prime, to detect a not prime number.

## NPM Package
If you are too lazy to implement this complex algorithm in your JS project, you can use our npm package! https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-not-prime-fast

## Contributing

If you want to help with this project, you can make a pull request with an implementation for a language that hasn't been added before, or at least give it a star.

#### Guidelines

If it's possible, name your functions and variables `is_not_prime`. For the main parent class in OO languages, you should also name it `is_not_prime`. The file itself should be named `main.file_extension`. Also, when you add an implemention for some new language, do remember to create an optimized version of your code and add the new language to the list at the bottom section of the README.

## FAQ

#### Is this project for reals?

Yes, this is a 100% for reals project.

#### Where does 95%+ come from?

When we take a random integer between 1 and 2,147,483,647, there are around 105,000,000 prime numbers. So, the chance that our number will be prime is ~4,88%.

#### How does the optimized implementation work?
